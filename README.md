# Overview
Accompanying source material for the YouTube channel [Composite Decomposition](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoIzuQPcDtFwd1CPS-5tnJA). This is a repository with subfolders for the corresponding videos; you can easily map video sequence numbers (IDs), shown in the lower left corner of every video's title slide, with the bullet numbers in the TOC below. The other details about content is given in the videos.

:information_source: Slides for videos can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X6XTbhMM_CAfaKP40pqBXpb3gCgv3-Mz?usp=sharing). Each presentation follows the `Video_<ID>.pptx` file naming convention (for example, `Video_1.pptx`). The only exception is the `Trailer.pptx` that contains slides for the channel's introductory video.
