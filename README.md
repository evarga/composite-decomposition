# Overview
This repository contains accompanying source material for the YouTube channel [Composite Decomposition](http://www.youtube.com/@composite-decomposition). It has subfolders for the corresponding videos; slides can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X6XTbhMM_CAfaKP40pqBXpb3gCgv3-Mz?usp=sharing). Each presentation follows the `<subfolder name>.pptx` file naming convention (for example, `barns.pptx`). The only exception is the `trailer.pptx` that contains slides for the channel's introductory video.

If you have a proposal for a new topic that you would like me to cover, then create an issue here. Of course, don't forget pressing the _Subscribe_ button to avoid missing novel presentations.
